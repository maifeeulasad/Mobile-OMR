# Mobile-OMR
This is a project based on Computer vision , to assess mark sheet . OMR machines are very costly and that’s why this device is not reach to many institute . So my target is to build a system that is cheap and easy to use (in mobile) to ensure OMR based assessment goes on without any further problem(s) . This project is steel under development . This project can detect multiple marking , can accept multiple answer for same question , half filled bubbles are not detected . Bubbles created with pencils are automatically rejected .  Future – This project can be taken further and used to automate industry , institute (school , collage , university ) ,  office . As it will be cheap , it will also be time consuming .
